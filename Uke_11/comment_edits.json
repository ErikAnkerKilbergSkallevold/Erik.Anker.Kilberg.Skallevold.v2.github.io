At first I thought x265 was so great because you could turn 150GB in 50GB but at the end of the day, it's compressed. You can still have x265 with 6CH audio, but in my opinion, the picture looks sharper in x264. I have done MANY personal tests. What I have decided on is real TV Shows and Movies - I go for x264. If its animation (Family Guy, etc etc) - I am fine with x265 as Cartoons compress much better while not showing many artifacts. All of this of course is just my opinion and preference. It is a fact though, that x265 is more compressed than x264. Last thing is space is getting cheaper. 5 years from now, when 20TB HD are only $200-$300 bucks, everyone who had a choice to grab the x264 but chose x265 will prob wish they had just gotten the x264 in the first place.

So when it does find something that matches it and it is a video file, there's a very high probability that it is the movie itself. So the program notifies the concerned person and it gets DMCA'd.\n\nBut when the file is in a compressed package and has said keyword in name, the program can't confirm whether or not it is a pirated something. For example, I can upload a rar/zip file which says Infinity War Full.zip but it will actually be a documentary on the font Helvetica. So they just can't go DMCA'ing everything that seem to be what they think it is. Nonetheless if a human checks it, it will go down.
